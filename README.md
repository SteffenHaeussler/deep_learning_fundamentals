# Deep Learning fundamentals

This repo is intended as a personal basic knowledge collection on deep learning.
After two years of mostly engineering I figured out, that I forgot some basics.
Since the fundamentals of deep learning aren't that hard to understand, I looked for an easy way
to refresh my knowledge.


## Available Notebooks


### Basic understanding

Currently, the following modules have been implemented:

- [activation functions](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/activation_functions.ipynb)
- [NN class implementation](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/building_classes_for_nn.ipynb)
- [optimizer](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/optimizers.ipynb)

### Code samples for Keras/Tensorflow and PyTorch

Code samples for a simple linear regression with Keras and PyTorch:

- [simple regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/simple_regression.ipynb)


### gibberish

Only useful for general understanding - with copy and paste from DL from scratch repo:
- [neural network regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/neural_network_regression.ipynb)
