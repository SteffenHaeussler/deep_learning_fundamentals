# Deep Learning fundamentals

This is intended as a basic knowledge repository on deep learning. Since the
technological progess moves one, sometimes it is helpful too look up basics.
Especially in Deep Learning this is useful, since the mathematical principles stay the same, while the architectures increase in complexity.

Here I try to develop some simple understanding with code samples to the fundamentals
of deep learning.


# Available Notebooks

Currently, the following modules have been implemented:

- [activation functions](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/activation.ipynb)

- [manual linear regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/manual_linear_regression.ipynb)
- [neural network regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/neural_network_regression.ipynb)
