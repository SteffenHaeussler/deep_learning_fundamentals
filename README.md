# Deep Learning fundamentals

This repo is intended as a personal basic knowledge collection on deep learning.
I like to understand stuff from the basics, so my idea is to build up personal reference notebooks for different aspects of deep learning. I mainly follow [Deep Learning from Scratch - Weidman 2019](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-from/9781492041405/). Even the code looks the same, I never did copy & paste. I followed the textbook examples line by line to get an understanding, how everything works together. In case I went the easy step, I marked it in the code as a comment.
The intention is to have a start and that this repo will grow over the next years.

## Available Notebooks


### Basic understanding

Currently, the following modules have been implemented:

- [activation and regularization functions](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/activation_functions_and_regularization.ipynb)
- [NN class implementation](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/building_classes_for_nn.ipynb)
- [optimizer](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/optimizers.ipynb)

### Code samples for Keras/Tensorflow and PyTorch

Code samples for a simple linear regression with Keras and PyTorch:

- [simple regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/simple_regression.ipynb)


### gibberish

Only useful for general understanding - with copy and paste from DL from scratch repo:
- [neural network regression](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/deep_learning_fundamentals/blob/master/neural_network_regression.ipynb)
